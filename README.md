To ensure the reliability and functionality of a web service, QUnit and Playwright were used for comprehensive testing. These tools help validate the serviceâ€™s behavior through unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests, ensuring a seamless user experience and robust backend performance.
Testing Approach
1. Unit Testing with QUnit

    Purpose: QUnit is used to test individual functions and modules to verify that they work as expected.
    Focus Areas:
        Functionality of core logic
        API response validation
        Error handling and edge cases
        Data processing and transformations
    Benefits:
        Quick execution
        Isolates specific issues within the codebase
        Ensures code quality before integration

2. End-to-End (E2E) Testing with Playwright

    Purpose: Playwright is used for automating UI interactions to test the full functionality of the web service.
    Focus Areas:
        User workflows and interactions
        Form submissions and API calls
        Navigation and UI responsiveness
        Authentication and session management
    Benefits:
        Simulates real-world user behavior
        Detects UI and functionality issues
        Ensures compatibility across different browsers

How the Tests Are Executed

    QUnit Tests:
        Run in a test environment or browser.
        Each function is tested independently.
        Results are displayed in a structured format for debugging.

    Playwright Tests:
        Scripts interact with the web service as a real user would.
        Tests are executed in headless mode or with a visible browser.
        Screenshots and logs are captured for debugging.

Advantages of Combining QUnit and Playwright

âœ… Ensures both backend logic and frontend interactions work correctly.
âœ… Provides fast feedback loops during development.
âœ… Helps prevent regressions when making code changes.
âœ… Improves test coverage by verifying different layers of the service.

By using QUnit for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing, the web service is thoroughly validated, resulting in a stable, efficient, and user-friendly application. ðŸš€
